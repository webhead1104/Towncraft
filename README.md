# Towncraft

**Towncraft** brings Township to Minecraft. If you've played the mobile game by Playrix and thought "I wish I could do
this in Minecraft," that's what this plugin does.

## What is this?

This is a recreation of Township as a PaperMC plugin. You get the same town-building, farming, and factory management
gameplay, just in Minecraft.

**The basics:**

- Your town sits on an 8×8 grid. Each section has 54 tiles where you can place houses, buildings, and fields
- Run `/towncraft` to open your town menu and manage everything through chest GUIs
- Plant wheat, feed animals, run factories, and fulfill orders to level up

**What's in it:**

- Farming: Plant and harvest wheat fields
- Animals: Cows, chickens, and sheep that produce resources
- Factories: Bakery, Feed Mill, Dairy Factory, Sugar Factory, Textile Factory—all with proper production chains (wheat →
  cow feed → milk → dairy products, etc.)
- Train: Accept orders, fill them with goods, get construction materials back
- Helicopter: Fulfill item requests for coins and XP
- Buildings: All the houses and community buildings from Township levels 1–10
- Progression: Same XP and leveling system as Township

## Why would you want this?

Honestly? Because you like Township and want to play it in Minecraft. This isn't trying to be a general-purpose economy
plugin or add new mechanics to survival—it's specifically for Township fans.

Everything works like it does in the mobile game. The production chains, the building placement, the train and
helicopter mechanics—it's all kept as close to the original as possible.

## Before you download

**You need PaperMC** (Java 21+). This won't work on Spigot or Bukkit.

**Current status:** All the level 1–10 content is in and functional. You can play through it right now. Some balancing
is still being tweaked (animal times are a bit long), and more content is planned in 10-level increments.

**Each player gets their own town.** Visiting another player's town isn't in yet, but is planned.

**Storage:**
Defaults to local files, but you can use MySQL or MongoDB if you want.
Currently, you cannot move user data to another storage provider, but this is planned.

**This is a fan project**—not affiliated with Playrix, just made by someone who likes Township.
